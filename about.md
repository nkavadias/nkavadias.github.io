## About this blog

I've been working in technology for almost 20 years. I recently started studying at university again (for fun) and thought a blog might be a good place to share some of my essays. I may also cross post other blogs and things I have written in the last few years, and who know? maybe some new stuff too. 

For anyone that is curious, I am using GitHubs pages to post this blog with the [Jekyll Now template](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).
