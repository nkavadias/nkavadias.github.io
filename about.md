## About this blog

I've been working in technology for almost 20 years. I recently started studying at university again (for fun) and thought a blog might be a usefule forum to share some of my essays. If some of the posts seem a strange mixture of [APA 7th](https://libguides.library.usyd.edu.au/citation/apa7) referencing style and hyperlinks it's because I've tried to adapt the essays to be more easily readable in a web format. I may also cross post other blogs and things I have written in the last few years, and who know? maybe some new stuff too. 

For anyone that is curious, I am using GitHubs pages to post this blog with the [Jekyll Now template](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).
