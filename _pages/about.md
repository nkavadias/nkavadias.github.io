## About this blog

I've been working in technology for almost 20 years. I recently started studying cybersecurity at university (for fun) and thought a blog might be a useful forum to share some of my essays and other learning experiences. 
Posts that are adapted from university assignments may seem a strange mixture of [APA 7th](https://libguides.library.usyd.edu.au/citation/apa7) referencing style and hyperlinks. This is because I've tried to adapt the essays to be more easily readable in a web format. I may also cross post other blogs and things I have written in the last few years, and who knows? maybe some new stuff too. 

For anyone that is curious, I am using GitHubs pages for this blog with some customisations I've made to the  [Jekyll Now template](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). Page source is [here](https://github.com/nkavadias/nkavadias.github.io).

Also, the tagline isn't a typo, it's a Ralph Wiggum quote.
