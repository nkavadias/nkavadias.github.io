## About this blog

I've been working in technology for almost 20 years. During the start of the pandemic in 2020, I went back to university to study a [Master of Cybersecurity](https://itmasters.edu.au/course/master-of-cyber-security/){:target="_blank"} through [IT Masters](https://itmasters.edu.au/){:target="_blank"} for fun. I thought a blog might be a useful forum to share some of my essays, notes and other learning experiences. 

Many of my posts here are adapted from university assignments, which is why they may seem a strange mixture of [APA 7th](https://libguides.library.usyd.edu.au/citation/apa7){:target="_blank"} referencing and hyperlinks. This is because I've tried to adapt the essays to be more easily readable in a web format. I may also cross-post from other blogs and things I have written in the past, and who knows? maybe some new stuff too. 

For anyone that is curious, I"ve written this blog using GitHubs pages and Jekyll (opensource software and free hosting!) with some customisations to the [Jekyll Now template](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now){:target="_blank"}. Page source is [here](https://github.com/nkavadias/nkavadias.github.io){:target="_blank"}.

Also, the blog's tagline isn't a typo, it's a Ralph Wiggum quote.
