Welcome to *Nick's Cybersecurity Blog*! This blog shares my insights, strategies, and reflections on technology, cybersecurity and law. Over the years I've gained [some qualification](https://https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-kavadias/){:target="_blank"} in these areas and am particularly interested in the intersection of cybersecurity and law. 

Many of my posts here are adapted from my academic writings or past projects.  Some posts retain elements like [APA 7th](https://libguides.library.usyd.edu.au/citation/apa7){:target="_blank"} referencing, although I've tailored them to be more engaging for online readers.

For anyone curious, I’ve written this blog using GitHub Pages and Jekyll (open-source software and free hosting!) with some customisations to the [Jekyll Now template](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now){:target="_blank"}. Page source is [here](https://github.com/nkavadias/nkavadias.github.io){:target="_blank"}.

Also, the blog's tagline isn't a typo, it’s a playful nod to Ralph Wiggum from *The Simpsons*. Because, let’s face it, we all feel like Ralph Wiggum sometimes when learning something new.
